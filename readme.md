The name of the database is "blog"
To seed, run "rake db:seed" in the command-line
Then comment-out the seed file, so that it does not create duplicate entries later.

Currently, trying to get the code in the "/test" route to run without errors.

I need to figure out how to correctly set up the association between "posts", "tags", and a "posts_tags" join table. I have tried many different ways of naming the "posts_tags" table, and am still trying to get it to work.
